# The dnsip sensor will expose an IP address, fetched via DNS resolution, as its value.
# There are two operational modes:
# 
# 1. When you enable the sensor with minimal configuration, it will query
# the OpenDNS nameservers with the hostname myip.opendns.com, which will resolve
# to your external/public IP address.
# 2. If you specify a hostname, a regular DNS lookup will be performed, providing
# you the IP the hostname resolves to.
