# Home-Assistant-Config
## About
This is my Home Assistant configuration inspired by [Frenck's methodology](https://github.com/frenck/home-assistant-config) of having each file doing only one thing.

I chose this methodology because I like the way how the integrations are organized. I don't have to spend time looking through long files to find what I'm looking for. To add or to remove an integration is as easy as creating or removing a file.
